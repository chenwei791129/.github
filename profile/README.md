# Hi there 👋

My name is Jeff, and I am currently working as a **DevOps Engineer** at **Titansoft**.  

I have a deep passion for:
- 🏍️ Riding motorcycles
- 🤖 Exploring Artificial Intelligence
- ☸️ Learning Kubernetes-related technologies
- 🌐 Diving into the endless projects of the CNCF Landscape

Proudly hailing from **New Taipei City, Taiwan**, I am always eager to embrace new challenges, share knowledge, and stay curious in this ever-evolving tech world.
